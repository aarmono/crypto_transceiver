Crypto Voice Module Configuration

When the Crypto Voice Module is first powered on, configuration files are
copied from the SD card into system memory. There are two primary configuration
files uses by the Crypto Voice Module:

* crypto.ini
* asound.state

asound.state is used by the system to manage sound card state and is saved
when the headset or radio volume settings are adjusted.

crypto.ini is used by the Crypto Voice Module software to configure the
radio system. 

Changes to the in-memory configuration do not immediately take effect. The user
must explicitly apply the changes using the "Apply Current Settings" option.
This option does not write the settings to the SD card but notifies the system
that changes have been made to the system configuration. This option can be
useful to test changes before writing them to the SD card.

Because the system must be able to operate without an SD card installed in
the system, changes to the two files listed above are always made to the
in-memory configuration. Unless the user explicitly saves the settings to the SD
card, any changes will be lost the next time the system is powered on. This
option automatically performs an "Apply Current Settings" after the settings
have been written to the SD card.

It should also go without saying, but if there is no SD card installed in the
system, attempts to save settings to the SD card will fail.

To revert changes, the "Reload Settings from SD Card" option will reload the
configuration files from the SD card. Any changes not written to the SD card
will be lost. This option automatically performs an "Apply Current Settings"
after the settings have been loaded form the SD card.

The user can lock the display by selecting "LOCK" or pressing the Escape key
while in the main menu. This locks the display so settings cannot be viewed or
changed until the Crypto Voice Module is restarted. If the SD card is not
installed in the system, it should not be possible to view or change system
state at all unless a way is found to "jailbreak" out of this mode. The author
is not aware of any way to do so, but that doesn't mean no way exists.

If the Configuration Utility is Disabled in the the "Disable Configuration
Utilty" menu and that setting is saved to the SD card, the Crypto Voice Module
will power on with the display locked. Since this option obviously prevents the
use of the Configuration Utility to re-enable this setting, only do this if you
are absolutely sure you will not need to change settings.

Note that it still may be possible to read the contents of memory through
hardware probing. If this is a risk then physical measures should be taken to
reduce the probability of this occurring.

In situations where the severity of harm is high if a key is compromised, it
should be assumed that anyone with access to a Crypto Voice Module which is
powered on and/or has the SD card installed can obtain access to the encryption
key. The intended "fast wipe" method is:

1) Provide a user with a fully powered on Crypto Voice Module with the SD card
   removed
2) Instruct the user to physically disconnect power to the Crypto Voice Module
   to wipe the key

The crypto.ini File

There is a crypto.ini file burned into the system firmware that has a default
value for each configuration item supported by the system. Then a separate
user-specific crypto.ini file is loaded from the SD card, and settings
contained in that file (which can be configured by this utility or by hand)
override the default values burned into the firmware. To revert back to using
the default value for a setting burned into the firmware, select the "Default"
option. This will remove the value from the user-specific crypto.ini file,
and the system will go back to using the default setting.

Shell Access

The Shell provides low-level access to the operating system and system services.
It is primarily a developer tool. Up until now it has been a "hidden" feature
now made available in this Configuration Utility.

The entire system runs entirely from memory, so it is generally not possible to
damage the system in a way that cannot be repaired by simply power-cycling it.
However it is possible to make the system inoperable in such a way that
power-cyling it is necessary to restore function.
