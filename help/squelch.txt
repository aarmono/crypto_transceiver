Radio Squelch

The Crypto Voice Module employs two types of squelch on the input signal from
the radio. The first is a simple Noise Gate which looks at a modem frame's
worth of data and computes the Root Mean Square of that frame. If the RMS value
is above the Open Threshold, the signal is passed into the demodulator. If the
RMS value is below the Close Threshold, signal demodulation does not occur.
Usually the Open Threshold is higher than the Close Threshold, but the values
can also be equal. This Noise Gate is intended to work in combination with a
radio's squelch feature to save power when no signal is being received by the
radio, since demodulation can require considerable CPU/power usage

The second squelch is built into FreeDV itself and is based on signal quality.
It attempts to estimate the Signal to Noise Ratio of the input signal and
suppresses output of the signal to the headset if the SNR drops too low. If the
SNR squelch is disabled, any input received from the radio will be output to
the headset regardless of its quality, provided the intensity of the signal
is strong enough to pass through the Noise Gate.
